# pandahandler

Definition: A "panda" is an indexed data series or frame, making it possible to access data in the ith element, row, or column directly by its index value(s).

This package is for working with pandas such as pandas.DataFrame and pandas.Series. In theory it could extend to other kinds of pandas, such as `polars` objects if polars ever introduces indexed data series or frames.
